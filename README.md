### Processing and Properties: Linking Thin Film Morphology to its Creation

***

The goal of this project is to begin to establish a relationship between the processing conditions used to make a thin film, the chemical characteristics of the polymer, and the morphology of the film. These connections are crucial for the progression of technologies using organic semiconductors, such as OPVs, OFETs, and OLEDs.
