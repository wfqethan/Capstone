### Processing and Properties: Linking Thin Film Morphology to its Creation

***

The goal of this project is to begin to establish a relationship between the processing conditions used to make a thin film, the chemical characteristics of the polymer, and the morphology of the thin film. These connections are crucial for the progression of technologies using organic semiconductors, such as OPVs, OFETs, and OLEDs.

***
### Software Description

***

The final version of the software is capabable of reading raw microscope files of thin film from the users, processing through the aggregated txt file and producing a prediction of how crystal/amorphous the 
thin film is; as well as the charge mobility prediction.
